            <p class="item">“Oliver is my little tiger. Olive-coloured eyes, a bow-tie to match. He may look small and timid, but he is always so wild and free-spirited. He reminds me of myself, actually, because I used to be timid and shy, too, but with time, I have learned to reach for the stars. We are one alike.”</p>

            <p class="item">“I was interested in cats until I started looking after my son's cat. I was first captivated by Jimi’s cute little crossed eyes, and then I got to know his sweet nature; I just had to bring him home. Now, he is a part of my life. He needed me as much as I needed him.”</p>
